  desc: 'Attention mechanism has recently attracted increasing attentions in the field of facial action unit (AU) detection. By finding the region of interest of each AU with the attention mechanism, AU-related local features can be captured. Most of the existing attention based AU detection works use prior knowledge to predefine fixed attentions or refine the predefined attentions within a small range, which limits their capacity to model various AUs. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning based attention and relation learning framework for AU detection with only AU labels, which has not been explored before. In particular, multi-scale features shared by each AU are learned firstly, and then both channel-wise and spatial attentions are adaptively learned to select and extract AU-related local features. Moreover, pixel-level relations for AUs are further captured to refine spatial attentions so as to extract more relevant local features. Without changing the network architecture, our framework can be easily extended for AU intensity estimation.'

  desc: 'Facial landmarks are highly correlated with each other since a certain landmark can be estimated by its neighboring landmarks. Most of the existing deep learning methods only use one fully-connected layer called shape prediction layer to estimate the locations of facial landmarks. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework named Multi-Center Learning with multiple shape prediction layers for face alignment. In particular, each shape prediction layer emphasizes on the detection of a certain cluster of semantically relevant landmarks respectively. Challenging landmarks are focused firstly, and each cluster of landmarks is further optimized respectively. Moreover, to reduce the model complexity, we propose a model assembling method to integrate multiple shape prediction layers into one shape prediction layer.'

We firstly keep a large weight for principal subset to make our network primarily predict their locations while slightly take elaborate subset into account. Next the weight of principal subset is gradually decreased until two subsets have equivalent weights. This process contributes to learn a good initial model and search the optimal model smoothly to avoid missing fairly good intermediate models in subsequent procedures.'

One of the most important reasons of this is the lack of training images annotated with landmarks due to fussy and time-consuming annotation work. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel data augmentation strategy. And we design an innovative training algorithm with adaptive learning rate for two iterative procedures, which helps the network to search an optimal solution. Our convolutional network can learn global high-level features and directly predict the coordinates of facial landmarks.'

  desc: 'Recent saliency detection methods have made great progress with the fully convolutional network. However, we find that the saliency maps are usually coarse and fuzzy, especially near the boundary of salient object. To deal with this problem, in this paper, we exploit a multi-path feature fusion model for saliency detection. The proposed model is a fully convolutional network with raw images as input and saliency maps as output. In particular, we propose a multi-path fusion strategy for deriving the intrinsic features of salient objects. The structure has the ability of capturing the low-level visual features and generating the boundary-preserving saliency maps. Moreover, a coupled structure module is proposed in our model, which helps to explore the high-level semantic properties of salient objects.'

Previous CNN based methods for saliency detection are universally accompanied with blurring edge and ambiguous salient object. To tackle this problem, we propose to embed the boundary enhancement block (BEB) into the network to refine edge. It keeps the details by the mutual-coupling convolutional layers. Besides, we employ a pooling pyramid that utilizes the multi-level feature informations to search global context, and it also contributes as an auxiliary supervision. The final saliency map is obtained by fusing the edge refinement with global context extraction.'

However, for the conditions with large pose and complex expression, these works usually suffer an eclipse. In this paper, we propose a two-stage cascade regression framework using patch-difference features to overcome the above problem. In the first stage, by applying the patch-difference feature and augmenting the large pose samples to the classical shape regression model, salient landmarks (eye centers, nose, mouth corners) can be located precisely. In the second stage, by applying enhanced feature section constraint to the patch-difference feature, multi-landmark detection is achieved.'

In this study, we discuss how to improve initialization by studying a neighborhood representation prior, leveraging neighboring faces to obtain a high-quality initial shape.

Cross-age variation is caused by the shape deformation and texture changing of human faces while people getting old. It will result in tremendous intra-personal changes of face feature that deteriorate the performance of algorithms. This paper proposed a deep feature based framework for face retrieval problem. Our framework uses deep CNNs feature descriptor and two well designed post-processing methods to achieve age-invariance.
